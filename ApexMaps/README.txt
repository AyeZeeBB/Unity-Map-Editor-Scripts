If you want to use the apex maps you must download the extra map models. I couldnt include these as they were to big for github.

You can download them here
https://github.com/R5Reloaded-ReMap/ReMap-Engine-Editor/releases/download/maps/MapAssets.zip

Just extract the Assets folder into your project dirrectory and replace if asked.
